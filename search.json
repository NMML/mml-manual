    "text": "2.2 Longer version - still need to edit\nThe Fay lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of group members or others in our larger communities in any form. Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form provides definitions and examples of harassment and sexual harassment.\nThis code of conduct applies to all Fay lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social get togethers, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the School’s and university’s academic policies.\nSome Fay lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.\nHarassment includes:\n\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.\n\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.\nPhysical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.\nThreats of violence.\nIncitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.\nDeliberate intimidation.\nStalking or following.\nHarassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.\nSustained disruption of discussion.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nPattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\nContinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.\nDeliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.\nPublication of non-harassing private communication.\n\nThe Fay lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The PI (Gavin Fay) reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:\n\n‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’\nReasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”\nCommunicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial\nCriticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n\n2.2.1 Reporting - still need to edit\nIf you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Gavin Fay, at gfay@umassd.edu. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Fay, please contact Department Chair Dr. Steve Cadrin scadrin@umassd.edu and/or SMAST Assistant Dean Mike Marino mmarino@umassd.edu. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.\nLab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of Massachusetts’ policies and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Information about the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form.\nConfidentiality: Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Dr. Fay is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr. Fay, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Gavin will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact David Gomes, UMass Dartmouth Director of Diversity and Inclusion.\nThis code of conduct applies to Fay lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab or another member of the SMAST community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Fay lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Fay lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Fay lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Fay lab. The University Counseling Center provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns.\nTo protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nThe above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Fay lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\n2.2.2 Consequences - still need to edit\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dr. Fay may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair and Dean’s Office under the SMAST policy, and also including expulsion from all Fay lab spaces.\n\n\n2.2.3 Additional resources - still need to edit\nOther University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees and University documents:\n\nPolicy Against Intolerance\nPrinciples of Employee Conduct\nResolution in Support of Pluralism\nNon-Discrimination and Harassment Policy\nStatement of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity\nStatement on Cultural Diversity and Inclusion\nStatement on Gender Discrimination\nBully, Harassment and Violence\nStudent Conduct Policies and Procedures\nSexual Harassment Policy\nTitle IX and Sexual Assault/Harassment"

Be prepared to show your CAC to the guards at the front gate and the front door of your work building each day. Cards must be renewed every three years.\n\n\n3.2.2 Office and Laboratory Space\nAFSC policy states:\nAs stewards of the NOAA Fisheries science mission in Alaska, the AFSC has a mandate to ensure our use of all available resources including physical office, laboratory, and warehouse space, supports the mission. Divisions have differing needs for space and the Science Director’s Office has delegated space allocation to the Divisions. If you have questions regarding how decisions regarding space are made in your Division, please pose these to your Divisional leadership.\nOffice assignments are based on criteria that include time in service, highest held degree, performance, and whether an FTE or non-Federal employee. Check with MML Admin first to see if a they have a key for your office. If not, request a key from the WRC Security office. Please keep in mind this form can only be signed by your Division Director.\nMML’s laboratory spaces are shared by all programs and staff. For information on lab space use see the Lab Safety chapter.\n\n\n3.2.3 Conference Rooms and Hybrid Meetings\nShared resources such as conference rooms are to be shared for maximum space utilization and mission support. While the names of conference rooms may be associated with a specific Division (e.g. the MML conference Room), these are available for all users.\nWith meetings now occurring onsite and virtually, the AFSC has provided Guidance on Holding Inclusive Meetings in a Hybrid Work Environment. Links to setting up conference rooms with access to Google Meet, Cisco WebEx, and toll free conference call lines can be found here.\n\n\n3.2.4 Parking and Transportation\nParking onsite requires obtaining a WRC decal for your vehicle. Take your completed form to the Pass & ID office in Building 1 (west end, top floor).\nNOAA also offers a non-taxable transit-fare subsidy program to encourage federal employees to use public mass transportation while commuting to and from work. Reimbursement to employees who use a non-motorized bicycle for a substantial portion of travel between your residence and the worksite is also availabe."

Notify your coworkers prior to working in the lab and ensure that at a minimum of 1 person - either nearby or available via call/text - is aware that the work is occurring. Never enter or work in a walk-in freezer without a (in-person or virtual) buddy.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 JHAs and SOPs\nApproved Job Hazard Analysis and Standard Operating Procedures documentation are required for all activities conducted in the MML Shared Labs. Create a workflow for this…\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Storage and Labels\nAll hazardous materials in the labs must be labeled according to AFSC and OSHA guidelines. At minimum, this includes the chemical name and primary hazard (pictogram sticker). Unknown, unlabeled chemicals are a dangerous and expensive hazard. They cannot be disposed of until they are identified and tests cost approximately $800 per sample. Pictogram stickers are available from the Shared Labs Manager or AFSC SECO.\nNon-hazardous items should also be clearly labeled with a contact name or program and a description of the item (e.g., SSL scats). For walk-in freezer items, paper tags, Sharpies, and color-coded flagging tape are available in the Freezer Room. Color-coded masking tape (for cabinet doors) is available from the Shared Labs Manager.\n\nHazardous materials must be stored in appropriate containers and locations. For example:\n\nOnly store compatible materials together (e.g., flammables with flammables).\nNo liquid hazards may be stored above eye level.\nCorrosives must be stored in a secondary container.\n\nOther items should be stored in your program’s designated area(s) of the labs or freezers. Storage is defined as anything that will not be in use within the next week. Items left in common areas will be reported to lab POCs.\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Chemical Inventories and Reporting\nMML must maintain a detailed inventory of all chemicals used and stored in the field, offices, and storage areas. The inventory is for chemical products only, not specimens stored in chemicals - although your program should keep an inventory of such items for the Tier II Report (see below).\nThe Shared Labs Manager is responsible for reviewing the MML chemical inventory and updating this information in the AFSC Chemical Inventory. This must be done at least annually. Create a workflow for this…\nWashington State Tier II Hazardous Chemical Reporting\nEach January, AFSC must report totals of ethanol, formaldehyde, and sulfuric acid to the State. This report includes chemical products as well as specimens stored in chemicals. In Nov-Dec, the Shared Labs Manager will reach out to programs about inventory these resources, and compile a summary report for AFSC SECO.\nFormalin Reporting\nWe are also required to report all new purchases of formalin or formaldehyde to AFSC SECO. Please notify the Shared Labs Manager if you buy these chemicals.\n\n\n\n6.1.6 Freezers\nMML has 2 large walk-in freezers, 1 mini fridge, 1 commercial standing freezer, and 4 ultra-low standing freezers. Freezers are for biological specimens only - absolutely no food or beverages are allowed. Emergency contacts are posted on the door of each unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreezer\nProgram\nLocation\nContents\n\n\n\n\n-40° (#1)\nAEP\nFreezer Room\nGenetic samples\n\n\n-80° (#2)\nPEP & AEP\nFreezer Room\nPEP blood and genetics samples, AEP blood samples\n\n\n-40° (#3)\nCCEP\nFreezer Room\nBlood and genetic samples\n\n\n-80° (#4)\nAEP\nFreezer Room\nBlood samples\n\n\n-20° (standing)\nCCEP\nTooth Lab\n???\n\n\n-20° (walk-in)\nShared\nFreezer Room\nDiet and tissue samples, etc.\n\n\n-20° (walk-in)\nShared\nBldg 32\nDiet and tissue samples, etc.\n\n\nMini-fridge\nShared\nPelagic Lab\nSample controls\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nDo not store samples in another program’s freezer without their express permission.\nNever put dry ice in the walk-in freezers - this is a suffocation hazard.\nBe sure that freezer doors are firmly closed when you’re done.\nProtect your hands when working with samples in/from the ultra-low freezers.\nIf you are shipping frozen samples, there are extra cold packs in the Bldg 4 walk-in and some insulated boxes under the counter.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.7 Cleaning and Waste Disposal\nPlease clean up after yourself in the labs. There are loads of cleaning supplies and tools available to you.\n\nScrub or wipe down surfaces.\nPut away supplies, tools, and equipment.\nDispose of waste in the appropriate receptable (see below).\nMake sure anything you leave in a common space is well-labeled.\nIf working in a sink, pouring off excess liquids from a bucket, or emptying a steam kettle, use a drain catcher or metal sieve to catch solids.\nFor bigger messes in the Dissection Lab, you can hose down surfaces and clean with Simple Green or another disinfectant. Waste water can go into the floor drains marked SEWER (you can use the small plastic broom and floor squeegee). Do not use the drains marked BLOOD!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaste type\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nBiowaste\nSolid organic matter (e.g., tissue, bone, etc.) should be collected in the Building 4 walk-in freezer. There are two large garbage cans on casters for this purpose. Absolutely no trash or plastic, and no tissues preserved in chemicals (e.g., ethanol, formalin). Do not fill bins more than 3/4 full. If needed, put excess waste in a 5-gallon bucket with a lid. Note: There is no longer a waste receptacle in the Building 32 walk-in - if this is something you need, contact the Shared Labs Manager.\n\n\nChemicals\nThere are glass jars on the counter in the Pelagic Lab for collecting waste alcohol, DMSO, and formalin. If you need a new container, grab an empty jar from the “ref collection glassware” cabinet; be sure to label it appropriately. Never dispose of chemicals in sinks or floor drains - even highly diluted ethanol!\n\n\nBroken glass\nThere is a broken glass bucket located in the Dissection Lab. Never put broken glass in the garbage or sharps containers.\n\n\nSharps\nUsed scalpels, needles, and other sharps go in the yellow/red plastic biohazard containers - there are several located throughout the labs.\n\n\nBatteries\nDead batteries go in the Universal Waste boxes in the MML Copy Room.\n\n\n\nThe Shared Labs Manager will monitor biowaste receptables and coordinate pick-up/disposal by Baker Commodities (rendering plant). Otherwise, if you see that a waste receptacle is full, fill out the AFSC Waste Pickup Form. Please note that there is a Center-wide monthly limit on formalin/formaldehyde disposal. If you need to dispose of large amounts of these chemicals, please coordinate with SECO before you begin.\n\n\n\n6.1.8 Other Shared Labs Resources\n\nElectric chain hoist\nSteam kettles (2)\nDissecting microscopes\nUltrasonic cleaner (small)\nDigital scales…\nTooth saw…\nTooth grinder…\nFreezing microtome…\n\nAt this time, there is not a chemical fume hood available in the Shared Labs. Options include the hood in the MML Tech Lab (typically used for charging UAS batteries) or the REFM Food Habits Lab (contact Geoff Lang and Rick Hibpshman)."
